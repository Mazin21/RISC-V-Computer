# How to compile

You'll need a RISC-V C/C++ compiler, I personally use <a href="https://gnutoolchains.com/risc-v/"> this one </a> for my windows machine. <br />
Download and install "risc-v-gcc10.1.0.exe" and leave things to defaults. <br />
Open up the terminal navigate to "projects/project template" directory and type "make all" to compile the program.  <br />
After compilation type "make bin" to generate a main.bin file. <br />
From logisim load the main.bin file into the computer's memory module.
