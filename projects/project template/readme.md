# How to compile

### You'll need a RISC-V C/C++ compiler, I personally use <a href=" https://gnutoolchains.com/risc-v/"> this one </a> for my windows machine. 

### Download and install "risc-v-gcc10.1.0.exe" and leave things to defaults.

### Open up the terminal navigate to projects/project template directory and type "make all" to compile the program. 

### After compilation type "make bin" to generate a main.bin file.

### From logisim load the main.bin file into the computer's memory module.
